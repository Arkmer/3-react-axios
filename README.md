# Axios Test App
Basically I can't seem to get axios to work so I'm going as bare bones as possible so I can see what goes where then beef it up later.
## Things Installed
- "axios": "^0.18.0",
- "express": "^4.16.3",
- "react": "^16.5.2",
- "react-dom": "^16.5.2",
- "react-scripts": "1.1.5"
## Current status
Axios is not working, I am firmly in the error 404 category.
